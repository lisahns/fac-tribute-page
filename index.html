    <h1>ALMUDENA ROMERO</h1>
    <div class="top">
    <p class="firstP">
        <i>Almudena Romero</i> is an artist working with organic matter and naturally occurring photographic 
        processes, practicing a deeply research-based approach. She addresses humanity's relationship 
        with nature with an innovative approach and develops a more appreciative attitude towards the 
        environment by adopting innate photographic qualities of plants into her practice. With her work, 
        she views and reconsiders photography as a process rather than the traditional form of representation 
        and documentation that it is commonly associated with. The photographic process for her can be 
        understood as writing with light a very simple rudimentary concept allowing for liberation and
         the opportunity to become more performative and conversational. While reflecting on the 
         physicality of photographs, Romero is focusing on and investigating sustainable photographic
          materials, enabling photography the prospect of a sustainable future. With her practice, 
          she also reflects on the questions of what can be understood as a photographic image or
           material, as well as new ways to describe photography.
           <br>
           In her project <i>Growing Concerns</i>, Romero uses the process of chlorophyll printing, which naturally occurs 
           in leaves without the need for any additional chemistry or substances. This is possible by an 
           oxidisation reaction, in which plant pigments are destroyed by being exposed to an extraordinary 
           amount of sunlight. The canvases for this project are plants that are native to former British 
           colonies, reflecting on the links between, trade, colonialism and migration and revealing their 
           legacies in contemporary Britain.

    The prints consist of archival imagery surrounding the colonial history of Britain, such as cinema and press 
    images, portraits of abolitionists, Queen Elizabeth's portrait printed on Jamaican currency, photographs of 
    protests racism in the UK, an image of the “Empire Windrush” boat, 
    and many more. With this work Romero incorporates the very matter that was subjugated 
    to colonialism and encapsulates images of people that were and still are directly affected by its 
    consequences. Here the materials are bearer of crucial connotations to trade and colonialism, making 
    it a collaborator and assisting Romero in creating meaningful connections between content and process. 
    By avoiding chemicals, papers, and other harmful elements her work has a considerably smaller effect 
    on the environment than conventional photography.

Yet, the processes Romero uses in her work are not necessarily new or too far away from traditional 
photography. In fact, researcher such as John Herschel and other researchers described these and 
similar processes in their papers as  
early as in the 19th century. During this time, a lot of research on plant-based photography has 
emerged following efforts to produce colour photographs using natural pigments. Romero argues that 
these types of processes have “been ignored because [they] did not favor the capitalist exploitation 
of the medium. Chemical photography – the easiest to market – prevailed” (Jenot, 2021, np). 
Many sustainable techniques can be practiced at home, with materials freely available or for very 
low cost, making it very accessible to a number of people. In this context, it is interesting that 
Romero mentions this as a reason why these practices have been widely neglected in photography. If 
photography is practiced in the way it is commonly understood now, it usually involves investing 
money on materials, such as cameras, films, chemicals, and so on.

        By rethinking photography and finding alternative ways to capture light, Romero widens the 
        realm of photography and frees her practice from the dependence of corporations and 
        organisations that produce photography supplies while gaining a deeper understanding and 
        reflection of the materials  
that are used. Additionally, it is interesting to note the connections between Romero's work on 
colonialism and Demo's piece Decolonizing Nature: in a way, Romero's work not just a commentary of 
the European colonialism it also reflects on exploitation and appropriation as traits of capitalism. 
Romero herself has been an immigrant to many different countries and was living in the UK during the 
Brexit movement in 2016. During this time, she visited different markets to carry out research on 
plants and saw plants and flowers being imported daily with very little or no restrictions. This 
motivated her contemplation of the historic interest in the reinforcement of free movements of capital 
and goods and the growing concerns in restricting movement of people. Romero uses the example of the 
Netherlands being the biggest flower market in the world, a title rooted in Europe's colonial past, 
where goods were taken away from the Colonies and brought to Europe as “exotic” and expensive goods. 
With Growing Concerns, Romero aims to reflect on this legacy along with the impending challenges this 
poses,<i> “such as the creation of new barriers … as well as the growing inequality, anger and support 
for extreme parties” </i>(Hitzeman, 2018, np). Achieving this deep connection between content and process 
is made possible to Romero by the matter that she worked with to create this project. Similarly, to 
Mandry, Romero relies on the matter she uses to produce meaning, the plants as canvases, but also as 
bearer of connotations of colonialism and therefore is a great example of the agency of matter and the 
collaboration between artist and matter.
<br>
Many plant-based practices currently have a limited life span, which is an interesting aspect to look 
at in conjunction with capitalism. Looking at Anthotypes, chlorophyll prints, and other similar 
processes, “these materials are ephemeral in the short run, but in the long run they are the only 
thing we will be able to practice”. These ephemeral processes seem contradicting 
to the way we currently buy and collect goods and it may seem absurd to spend money on work that has 
a limited life span, especially when photography is commonly understood as perpetual documentation. 
For Romero, it is of bigger importance to support a wider conversation around topics of photography, 
matter, and nature. Therefore, this way of  
working clashes with our current modes of consumption, unfastening new dialogues and approaches to 
our ways of consumption and the idea of personal possession. With her practice Romero seeks to inquire 
one's own practice and how it is contributing to the dynamics of production and accumulation, 
which are, according to her, the roots of the environmental issue at hand. She is hoping to 
contribute to a wider discussion on our relationship to nature and photographic processes. Congruent to 
new materialism, Romero asks <i>“fundamental questions about the nature of matter” as well as a 
“detailed analyses of our daily interaction with material object and the natural environment” </i>
(Coole and Frost, 2010, p.3).
